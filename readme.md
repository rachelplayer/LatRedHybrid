Sage implementations for the optimization of the attack parameters and security estimates for the classical and quantum hybrid attack provided in [2] by Thomas Wunderer. Parts of the implementation are based on a previous implementation for the security estimates of [1] by Florian Goepfert, Rachel Player, and Thomas Wunderer.

Note: The original code was provided by Thomas Wunderer. Rachel Player has edited the code to make the following changes:
1. provide documentation via comments
2. add additional cost models for BKZ
3. rename variables to align with the notation in [2]
4. estimate security against the hybrid attack of typical homomorphic encryption parameters, documented in Wunderer-analysis-FHE.pdf

Independently and concurrently to the work described in point 4, Son and Cheon [3] also applied a Wunderer-style analysis of the hybrid attack in the FHE parameter setting.
