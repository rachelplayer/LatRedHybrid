Sage implementations for the optimization of the attack parameters and security estimates for the classical and quantum hybrid attack provided in [2] by Thomas Wunderer. Parts of the implementation are based on a previous implementation for the security estimates of [1] by Florian Goepfert, Rachel Player, and Thomas Wunderer.

Note: The original code was provided by Thomas Wunderer. Rachel Player has edited the code to make the following changes:
- provide documentation via comments
- add additional cost models for BKZ
- rename variables to align with the notation in [2]
- estimate security against the hybrid attack of typical homomorphic encryption parameters
